	Create a composite image by appending the data in the specified file to that which exists in the current image buffer. The width of the specified file must be the same as that of the current image. 

COMTEMPIMAGE name 
	Create a composite image by appending the data in the named temporary image to that which exists in the current image buffer. The width of the specified temporary image be the same as that of the current image.
	
COLORFLAG [value]
	If an argument is given, the IS_COLOR flag is set to 0 (flag = 0) or 1 (anything else). If no argument is given, the current value of the color flag is printed.

CMINMX n m 
	Specifies the minimum (n) and maximum (m) values in the data that correspond to the minimum and maximum color or gray scale values. Specifying the values causes the "Auto Scale" feature to be disabled. If the arguments are not given, the "Auto Scale" feature is enabled.

DISPLAY [string] 
	Opens a window on the Macintosh screen and displays the contents of the current data buffer. The color palette used can be determined by the PALETTE command. The color minimum and maximum are specified by the CMINMX command. There can be up to 9 image windows open at one time. Windows can be resized, moved around the screen, and closed as in other Macintosh applications. If the optional string is specified, the window will be named according to the string.

DMACRO [n] [command]
	Prompts the user for lines of a command macro to be executed using the RMACRO command. If the argument n is omitted, definition starts with line one. If n is specified, definition begins with the nth line of the macro. To include numerical arguments that change each time the macro is executed, %d can be inserted in the macro command at the location where the number will be placed upon execution of the macro. If "command" is not present, the program prompts for additional command lines until a null command is entered (i.e. <CR> only). If the optional "command" is included on the same line, the text of "command" replaces any command already existing at line n and no further command lines are solicited. Dummy arguments in Macros or Execute files include the following:
	%c  the number of seconds since OMA was started (float)
	%d  a decimal digit
	%s  the string specified by the STRMAC command

	Use the VALMAC command to specify the starting value and increment.
	%e  the result of the last error code (0 means no error)
	%a  the average within the currently defined rectangle
	%r  the rms within the currently defined rectangle
	%h  the height of the current image
	%w  the width of the current image
	%x  the x pixel coordinate of the last mouse click
	%y  the y pixel coordinate of the last mouse click
	%p	Filled in with the "save data" prefix
	%q	Filled in with the "get data" prefix

DIVFILE <filename>
	Divides the data in the current buffer by the contents of the specified file.

DIVTEMPIMAGE name
	Divides the data in the current buffer by the contents of the named temporary image.

ERASE [n] 
	If no argument is given, all image windows currently on the screen are closed. If a value n is specified, only window n is erased.

EXECUTE <filename>
	Reads OMA commands stored in the specified file into a special execute buffer and then performs those commands. Unlike macros, these should not contain dummy numerical arguments (%d).

FLOATVARIABLE variable_name
	Specifies that variable_name is to be used as a floating point variable.

FTEMPIMAGE tempImage
	Free memory associated with temporary image tempImage.
    tempImage must be in the range 0-9, or correspond to a named image.

GET <filename>  
	Loads the data from the specified file into the current image data buffer. The "Get Data Files" prefix and suffix are used.

GETSETTINGS [filename]
	Gets settings from the specified file (uses the appropriate prefix and suffix specified in the preferences). If no filename is given, OMA Settings from within the oma application are loaded. 

GTEMPIMAGE name
	Get temporary image that has been previously saved using STEMP.

HELP [command name or fragment]
	If a command name is given, a brief explanation of the command is printed in the command window. If only part of the command is given, a description of all commands that match the command fragment is printed. All help information is from the file "OMA HELP." If no argument is given, all command names are printed with no explanation.

INVERT
	Inverts the image in the current image data buffer, causing the first data point to become the last data point.

INTVARIABLE variable_name
	Specifies that variable_name is to be used as an integer variable.

LMACRO 
	Lists the contents in the current macro buffer.

LOOP variable_name start end [step]
	Initializes a loop. The variable_name can be any string of reasonable length. The variable takes on the initial value specified by "start" and the commands within the loop are repeated until the variable is >= "end". ( or <= "end" if step < 0) If step is not specified, a step of 1 is assumed. The end of the loop is specified by the LOOPND command. Each LOOP must have a corresponding LOOPND. To access the value of a loop variable, precede variable_name with "@" For example:
	loop fnum 2 10 2
	get data@fnum
	disp
	loopnd
	.
	.
	Note: To signify the end of a variable name when it is followed by other characters, use a '\' character. For example:
	loop fnum 2 10 2
	get data@fnum\_corrected
	disp
	loopnd

LOOPBREAK
	Break out of current loop.

LOOPND
	Specifies the end of a loop initiated with the LOOP command.

SAVSETTINGS [filename]
	Saves the current settings to the specified file (uses the appropriate prefix and suffix specified in the preferences). If no filename is given, OMA Settings are saved within the oma application. 

SIZE width height
	Set the width and height of the current image and zero the data.

STEMPIMAGE name
	Save current image as temporary image with specified name. The name can be 0-9 or a text string beginning with a lower case letter. This can be retrieved with GTEMP.

SMOOTH [n,m] 
	Performs an n x m smoothing operation on data in the current image buffer.  If only n is specified, an n x n smoothing is done; with no argument, a 2 x 2 smoothing is performed.  For the smoothing operation to be perfectly centered on each data point, the arguments must be odd. For Gaussian smoothing, use GSMOOTH.

SUBFILE <filename>
	Subtracts the contents of the specified file from the data in the current buffer.

SUBTEMPIMAGE name
	Subtracts the contents of the named temporary image from the data in the current buffer.

	The values of variables are accessed from other commands using @my_var. For example,
	+ @my_var
	or
	save datfile_@4myvar
	As with loops, the end of a variable can be tagged by adding a '\' For example,
	save datfile_@my_var\_corrected
	See also commands FLOAT and INTVARIABLE
