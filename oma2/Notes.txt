√load and save prefs -- do on start and quit

√macros enabled and define macros
    √define macro starting at line number doesn't work right
     
initializations:
    √palettes
    √prefs

√drag and drop -- shouldn't use fullname

√when displaying in a macro, window should draw contents before the end of the macro
      this also causes a malloc error in drawRect when guard malloc is enabled
      
√crop of color image has bad access if rectangle goes all the way to the bottom of the image
    √also trouble with monochrome crop -- problem is with verticle part of rectangle coorinates returned by the UI 
    I'm using a defined constant for the TITLEBAR_HEIGHT -- that probably isn't right

√rework min/max

Status Window:
    √ show color bar

√ help file


Needed Commands
 SAVE command
 LOG command
 GET command -- should get any kind of readable file?
 
Existing Command Issues:
    CROP has bugs when image is big
    ERASE [n] to just erase nth window
 
 UI Issues:
    when the status window is selected, typing a space isn't sent to the command window
    Big image issues:
        Image scaling is wrong when image is big -- scales vertically but not horizontally
        X Y coordinates (and Z values) are wrong
        Presumably this is the source of the trouble with the CROP command
    
UI Needs
    release window when click on close
    find which window is active
    -> open a lineplot window and plot graphics
        get the bitmap data from a window for line plots
    copy from an image window

    Prefs:
        -> select color bar


Display a data window

in comdec.mm:
display_data (alias to #define display_data [appController showDataWindow:(char*) args]; in UI.h)


appController showDataWindow:windowname (invoked from from display as above)
    // figure out where to place image
    screen size is:
        screenRect.size.width
        screenRect.size.height
