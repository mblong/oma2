√load and save prefs -- do on start and quit

√macros enabled and define macros
    √define macro starting at line number doesn't work right
     
initializations:
    √palettes
    √prefs

√drag and drop -- shouldn't use fullname

√when displaying in a macro, window should draw contents before the end of the macro
      this also causes a malloc error in drawRect when guard malloc is enabled
      
√crop of color image has bad access if rectangle goes all the way to the bottom of the image
    √also trouble with monochrome crop -- problem is with verticle part of rectangle coorinates returned by the UI 
    I'm using a defined constant for the TITLEBAR_HEIGHT -- that probably isn't right

√rework min/max

Status Window:
    √ show color bar

√ help file

√printf

√GET anImage.nef and anImage.jpg    -- implemented; needs verification
√SAVE command -- added
√LIST command
√NEWWINDOW command
√ GETFILENAMES
√ NEXTFILE
√ STRMACRO
√ GMACRO
√ GETFILENAMES
√ NEXT
√ RMACRO added

Addressed Existing Command Issues:
    √CROP has bugs when image is big
    √ERASE [n] to just erase nth window

Addressed UI Issues:
    √Big image issues:
        Image scaling is wrong when image is big -- scales vertically but not horizontally
        X Y coordinates (and Z values) are wrong
        Presumably this is the source of the trouble with the CROP command
  √copy from an image window
  √release window when click on close
  Drop Files onto status broken. -- seems to work

_____________________________
Needed Commands
 LOG command
 GET command --  ".tif" still needed.

Need to implement command history and up arrow

Existing Command Issues:

Need to be able to stop macros

UI Issues:
    when the status window is selected, typing a space isn't sent to the command window -- sometimes?
    
    Crash on resizing data window that isn't the current one when size is smaller than original. in DataView.mm drawRect

    
UI Needs


    -> open a lineplot window and plot graphics
        get the bitmap data from a window for line plots
        Still issues here:
            Bitmap returned is different than the one set due to display profile mapping
            Crashes on print or resize of drawing window (fixed)
            Can't copy (but can print) (fixed)


    Prefs:
        -> select color bar

    Status:
        -> Display macro number

Implementation Notes

Display a data window
in comdec.mm:
display_data (alias to #define display_data [appController showDataWindow:(char*) args]; in UI.h)


  appController showDataWindow:windowname (invoked from from display as above)
    // figure out where to place image
    screen size is:
        screenRect.size.width
        screenRect.size.height

To find which window is active:
    [NSApp keyWindow]       -- NSApp is a global defined in Cocoa
