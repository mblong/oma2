√load and save prefs -- do on start and quit


√macros enabled and define macros
    √define macro starting at line number doesn't work right
     
initializations:
    √palettes
    √prefs

√drag and drop -- shouldn't use fullname

√when displaying in a macro, window should draw contents before the end of the macro
      this also causes a malloc error in drawRect when guard malloc is enabled
      
√crop of color image has bad access if rectangle goes all the way to the bottom of the image
    √also trouble with monochrome crop -- problem is with verticle part of rectangle coorinates returned by the UI 
    I'm using a defined constant for the TITLEBAR_HEIGHT -- that probably isn't right

√rework min/max
