The Command Window can be        resized, and moved but not closed. Text scrolled off the top of the        window is not lost and can be viewed using the scroll controls.<br />        <br />        A blinking cursor is displayed when the Command Window is selected. The        standard prompt for new commands is "OMA2&gt;". Commands entered from        the keyboard are terminated with "return" or "enter". Only the first        part of a command name needs to be entered. If this leads to ambiguity        the parser will take the first suitable command (in alphanumeric order)        that appears in the internal command buffer, so caution should be        exercised when abbreviating commands.<br />        <br />        <div class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block" style="height: 402px; width: 622px;  height: 402px; position: relative; width: 622px; "><img            style="border: none; height: 403px; width: 622px; "            alt=""            src="images/droppedImage_1.png" /></div>        <br />        <br />        Copying and pasting text in the command window works as in other        Macintosh applications. This may be useful for keeping a record of a        data taking session. It may also be useful to copy filenames or parts of        filenames so that they can be pasted with &lt;cmnd v&gt; or the "Paste"        menu item. <br />        <br />        <h1>Command Abbreviations </h1>        <br />        OMA2 commands have from one to sixteen characters. Commands are not case        sensitive. It will always work to type the entire command, but it is        often convenient to abbreviate commonly used commands. When an ambiguous        character sequence is typed, the command interpreter will take the first        command from the internal command list that matches all of the        characters typed. Ordering in the internal list seeks to put the most        widely used commands toward the top of the list, thus maximizing the        extent to which they can be abbreviated. To see the internal ordering of        OMA2 commands, type HELP with no argument (or, as it turns out, just &#8220;H&#8221;        will do). This gives the internal list of commands. <br />        <br />        Some examples of commonly used commands and their shortest abbreviations        are as follows:<br />        <br />        d        DISPLAY<br />        e        ERASE<br />        g        GET<br />        gm     GMACRO<br />        gt       GTEMPIMAGE<br />        l         LMACRO<br />        r         RMACRO<br />        s        SAVEFILE<br />        st       STEMPIMAGE<br />        <br />        <h1>The Status Window </h1>        <br />        The Status Window controls the display of the data in the current image        buffer. The Status Window cannot be closed or resized, only minimized. <br />        <div class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_3 inline-block" style="height: 406px; position: relative; width: 274px; text-align: center;"><img            style="border: none; height: 406px; width: 274px; "            alt=""            src="images/droppedImage_2.png" /></div>        <br />        The top most pane contains information about the limit values for the        false color palette. The pixel intensity that corresponds to the first        value in the color map is displayed in the &#8220;Color Min:&#8221; register. The        pixel intensity corresponding to the last value in the color-map is        displayed in the &#8220;Color Max:&#8221; register. These values can be specified by        the CMINMX [n][m] command, or by using the buttons to increase or        decrease the values. The value is incremented by a percentage of the        difference between the maximum and minimum for the current image.        Sliding the &#8220;Min/Max Increment&#8221; control changes the increment. If the        &#8220;Update&#8221; set box is checked, the current displayed image (if there is        one) will be updated and redisplayed to the new color parameters. If the        &#8220;Scale&#8221; check box is checked, then the color map will scale to the        minimum and maximum intensities in the image, equivalent to using CMINMX        without arguments.<br />        <br />        The next pane gives information about the image dimensions, minimum and        maximum, location on a detector (X0, Y0), and information about pixel        binning (DX, DY). Below that are pixel locations and image values<br />        <br />        Cursor tools are selected using the icons in the next pane. The five        tools are used to (1) read out pixel values, (2) specify a rectangle on        the current image, (3) calculate quantities within a specified        rectangle, (4) measure distances on the current image, or  (5) plot the        intensity along a line specified on the current image (coming soon...).        <br />        <br />        <h1>File Prefixes and Suffixes </h1>        <br />        To specify the path and file type (or extension) for files typed in the        command window, prefixes and suffixes may be specified using the        Prefixes tab in the OMA Preferences &lt;cmnd ,&gt;:<br />        <br />        <div class="tinyText style_SkipStroke_2 inline-block" style="height: 488px; width: 622px;  height: 488px; position: relative; width: 622px; "><img            style="border: none; height: 488px; width: 622px; "            alt=""            src="images/droppedImage_3.png" /></div>        <br />        <br />        Different paths and suffixes can be used for &#8220;getting&#8221; and &#8220;saving&#8221; data        files, for macro files, or for Settings Files saved with the &#8220;SAVS&#8221; or        retrieved with &#8220;GETS.&#8221; OMA now uses the Mac unix style paths. In the        example above, data files would be saved and retrieved from a folder        named &#8220;recent&#8221; contained within a folder &#8220;image data&#8221; on the boot disk        (regardless of the name of the boot disk on the desktop). Macros would        be saved and retrieved from a folder named &#8220;macros&#8221; on a different disk        (or partition) that would appear on the desktop as &#8220;extra drive.&#8221;        Settings files accessed with the SAVSET or GETSET commands would be        saved within the folder containing the oma application.<br />        <br />        <h1>Using the Graphing Tools</h1>        <br />        A number of graphics tools are included in the Graph menu. These allow        data in displayed windows (or in some cases the data in the image        buffer) to be represented in a variety of ways.<br />        <br />        <h2>Row and Column Plots:</h2>        <br />        When a window containing a bitmap image is selected, the Plot Rows and        Plot Columns menu items can be used to plot the displayed intensity        along a row or column. Dragging the mouse in the bitmap window allows        real-time selection of different rows or columns.  Note that the row and        column plots correspond to the bit-mapped images, and not necessarily to        the data in the current image buffer. If the color minimum and/or        maximum do not correspond to the data minimum and/or maximum, the row        and column plots can appear clipped. Keyboard shortcuts for Row and        Column Plots are &lt;cmnd 1&gt; and &lt;cmnd 2&gt;, respectively. <br />        <br />        Like other OMA graphics windows, the Row and Column windows can be        copied to the clipboard as pdf files and pasted into applications that        accept pdf files directly (such as Textedit or Preview). Alternatively,        they can be saved as pdf files using the SAVPDF command or the &#8220;Save        Window as PDF...&#8221; menu item in the File menu.<br />        <br />         <br />        <br />        <h1>Getting Help </h1>        <br />        In addition to this web-based help, the HELP command can be typed in the        command window. Its format is as follows:<br />        <br />        HELP [command name or fragment]<br />        If a command name is given, a brief explanation of the command is        printed in the command window. If only part of the command is given, a        description of all commands that match the command fragment is printed.        All help information is from the file "oma2help.txt." If no argument is        given, all command names are printed with no explanation. Commands are        listed in the order that they appear in the internal command list.<br />        <br />        <br />      </div>      <div class="footer">Brought to you by Developers of OMA<br />          </div>    </div>  </body></html>
