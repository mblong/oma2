The width of the        specified file must be the same as that of the current image. The        OPENFLAG command works in conjunction with the COMPOSITE command in the        same way that it does with the GET command. <br />        <br />        COMTEMPIMAGE name <br />        Create a composite image by appending the data in the temporary image to        that which exists in the current image buffer. The width of the        specified file must be the same as that of the current image.<br />        <br />        FWDATMATLAB  &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Writes the data in the current buffer as a tab-delimited text file.        Format is a matrix of values that can be loaded directly into matlab.<br />        <br />        GET &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Loads the data from the specified file into the current image data        buffer. The "Get Data Files" prefix is used. The "Get Data Files" suffix        is used unless the specified filename has a suffix of .jpg, .tiff, .tif,        or .nef; in those cases no suffix is added and the appropriate decoding        routines are called according to the file type.<br />        <br />        GETSETTINGS [filename]<br />            Gets settings from the specified file (uses the appropriate prefix        and suffix specified in the preferences). If no filename is given, OMA        Settings from within the oma application are loaded.<br />        <br />        GETFUNCTION n filename<br />            Read in a tabulated function to be used by the LOOKUP command. n is        the function number to be defined. filename is file containing y=f(x)        data pairs, preceeded by number of table entries.<br />            Assumptions for tabulated functions:<br />            File format:<br />            first number is integer with the number of pairs to follow<br />            pairs are float with x followed by f(x) on the same line<br />            x values are ordered smallest to largest<br />            y = f(x) is single valued<br />        <br />        GETBINARYFILE &lt;filename&gt; rows columns headerBytes        bytesPerDataPoint swapBytesFlag [unsignedFlag]<br />            Read in a binary file with the specified parameters. If        bytesPerDataPoint is -sizeof(float), the binary data are treated as        float. Other reasonable values would be 1, 2, or 4.<br />        <br />        GMACRO &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Loads the contents of the specified file into the current macro        buffer.<br />        <br />        GETNEXT<br />            Get the next image from the file opened with the OPENFILE command.        If no additional image data is available, the open file is closed.<br />        <br />        GETFILENAMES NameFile<br />            Open NameFile (currently uses macro prefix and suffix) which        contains the names of files. The NEXTFILE command is used to open the        next file. NameFile is left open until all files have been accessed.<br />        <br />        NEXTFILE [prefix]<br />            Open the next file specified in the FileNames file that was opened        with the GetFileNames command. If a prefix is specified, that is added        to the name before trying to open the file. command_return_1 is the the        filename without any prefix and without the extension (last 4        characters).<br />        <br />        OPENFILE &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Reads data from the specified filename but does not close it. If        there is more than one image in the file, the GETNEXT command will read        the next image. This type of multi-image data file can be created with        the CREATEFILE, CONCATFILE, CLOSEFILE commands, or may be produced by        some cameras.<br />        <br />        SAVE &lt;filename&gt; <br />        Saves the current data buffer to the specified file.<br />        <br />        SAVSETTINGS [filename]<br />        Saves the current settings to the specified file (uses the appropriate        prefix and suffix specified in the preferences). If no filename is        given, OMA Settings are saved within the oma application. <br />        <br />        SATIFF &lt;filename&gt; <br />            Converts the contents of the OMA Image buffer to 8 bit unsigned data        and then uses the LibTIFF TIFFWriteEncodedStrip function to save the        data to a TIFF image specified on the command line. The 'save' file        prefixes are used. A ".tif" extension is automatically appended to the        filename. To save as a color image, use the COLORFLAG command to set the        flag appropriately.<br />        <br />        SATIFFSCALED min max &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Convert image to 16 bit and save as a TIFF file. Uses the specified        min and max for scaling rather than the min and max of the image in the        buffer. Results will be between 0 - 65535. Depending on min and max, the        image may be clipped or the full 16-bit dynamic range may not be used.        To save as a color image, use the COLORFLAG command to set the flag        appropriately.<br />        <br />        UPREFX type <br />            Force use of prefix/suffix specified by 'type.' Possible cases for        'type' include the following:<br />            s   Use Save File prefix and suffix for both saving and getting        files<br />            g   Use Get File prefix and suffix for both saving and getting files<br />            d   Use Default prefix and suffix<br />        <br />        CREATEFILE &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Opens a file with the specified name, saves the current data and        format information, and leaves the file open. Subsequently, the        CONCATFILE command can be used to add more data to the open file. use        CLOSEFILE to close the file. See also OPENFILE and GETNEXTFILE.<br />        <br />        CONCATFILE<br />            Saves the current data buffer to the file opened with the CREATEFILE        command. See also OPENFILE and GETNEXTFILE.<br />        <br />        CLOSEFILE<br />            Closes the file opened with the CREATEFILE command. See also        OPENFILE and GETNEXTFILE.<br />        <br />        FCLOSE<br />            Closes the currently open text file (there can be only one). The use        of FOPEN, FCLOSE, and FECHO allows derived values to be written to a        file from within a macro.<br />        <br />        FECHO string<br />            Writes the string to the file opened with FOPEN. A newLine is added        after the string unless the string ends in ..., in which case no newLine        is added. The use of FOPEN, FCLOSE, and FECHO allows derived values to        be written to a file from within a macro.<br />        <br />        FOPEN &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Open a text file with the name &lt;filename&gt; for I/O. The use of        FOPEN, FCLOSE, and FECHO allows derived values to be written to a file        from within a macro.<br />        <br />        <br />        <br />      </div>      <div class="footer">Brought to you by Developers of OMA<br />          </div>    </div>  </body></html>
