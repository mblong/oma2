No correction        is made when the value is less than thresholdCount. For a pixel with        pixValue greater than thresholdCount, pixValue is increased by         (pixValue-thresholdCount)*fraction. The pixel in the next column is        decreased by the same amount.<br />        <br />         BAYERFLAG [bayerFlagValue]<br />            Sets the value of the bayerFlag, which indicates if the FINDBAD        command should treat the image as an undemosaiced color image.

See        also FINDBAD.<br />        <br />         BITMAP2RGB<br />            Convert the current bitmap image to an RGB color image. This will        result in 8-bit integer data as the current image.<br />        <br />        BLINK [ticks first last]<br />            Blink comparitor between images stored as numbered temporary images        (allowed range is 0-9). ticks specifies the delay, in ticks, between        display of subsequent images. If more than two images are compared,        display ordering is first - last - first. Default values are 6, 0, and 1        for ticks, first, and last. Type &lt;return&gt; to end the BLINK        sequence. On completion, the image buffer will contain the last        temporary image in the sequence.<br />        <br />        CALCULATE<br />            Print calculations on the rectangle specified with the RECTANGLE        command or with the rectangle tools.

Dummy arguments in Macros or Execute files include the        following:<br />            %c  the number of seconds since OMA was started (float)<br />            %d  a decimal digit<br />            %s  the string specified by the STRMAC command<br />            %f  last file name<br />            %b  maximum value (big)<br />            %l  minimum value (little)<br />            %t  current date and time<br />            %k  current date formatted as yyyy-mm-dd<br />            %v  an integer value that increments by a specified amount every        time it is used<br />            Use the VALMAC command to specify the starting value and increment.<br />            %e  the result of the last error code (0 means no error)<br />            %a  the average within the currently defined rectangle<br />            %r  the rms within the currently defined rectangle<br />            %h  the height of the current image<br />            %w  the width of the current image<br />            %x  the x pixel coordinate of the last mouse click<br />            %y  the y pixel coordinate of the last mouse click<br />            %p    Filled in with the "save data" prefix<br />            %q    Filled in with the "get data" prefix<br />        <br />        DIVFILE &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Divides the data in the current buffer by the contents of the        specified file.<br />        <br />        DIVTMPIMAGE name<br />            Divides the data in the current buffer by the contents of the named        temporary image.<br />        <br />        DIFFX<br />            Differentiate the data in the current image data buffer in the x        direction. <br />        <br />        DIFFY<br />            Differentiate the data in the current image data buffer in the y        direction.<br />        <br />        DCRAWARGS  [arguments]<br />            Allows the user to specify the arguments passed to the dcraw        routine, which decodes camera raw files to OMA format. Omitting the        argument lists the allowed arguments and gives the current argument        settings. The filename field is ignored.<br />        <br />        DELAY nticks<br />            Waits nticks/60 seconds before continuing on to the next command.        Use this for rough timing operations.<br />        <br />        DMNMX<br />            Displays the color min and max in the window.<br />        <br />        DX n<br />            Specifies the number of detector pixels (not display screen pixels)        to be grouped (or binned) in the X direction.<br />        <br />        DY n<br />            Specifies the number of detector pixels (not display screen pixels)        to be grouped (or binned) in the Y direction.<br />        <br />        DOC2RGB c1 c2 c3 c4<br />            Treat the image in the current image buffer as a raw document        (output from the dcraw routine with options -d or -D selected) and        convert it to an RGB image. This is assumed to have a 2 x 2 color matrix        of R G B values in a Bayer pattern. c1 - c4 have values 0, 1 or 2,        corresponding to red, green, and blue. For example, if Bayer Matrix is:<br />            G B<br />            R G<br />            c1 - c4 should be 1 2 0 1<br />            Appropriate values depend on the specific camera. (See the output        from the GET command when reading raw files.)<br />        <br />        DOC2COLOR c1 c2 c3 c4 c5<br />            Treat the image in the current image buffer as a raw document (e.g.,        output from the dcraw routine with options -d or -D selected) and        convert it to an R, G, or B image. This is assumed to have a 2 x 2 color        matrix of R G B values in a Bayer pattern. c1 - c4 have values 0, 1 or        2, corresponding to red, green, and blue. For example if Bayer Matrix is<br />            G B<br />            R G<br />            c1 - c4 should be 1 2 0 1<br />            c5 is 0, 1, or 2 for conversion to red, green, or blue. Pixels        associated with non-selected colors have a value of 0. Doing a BLOCK 2 2        command after this command will remove the zeros. Blocking 2 by 2 on the        green channel will sum the two green pixels.<br />        <br />        DISP2RGB<br />            Convert the display image to rgb. Use this to turn a false color        intensity map into an RGB image or to modify a color image so the values        follow the display settings. Returned values are integers between 0 -        255.<br />        <br />        DOUTPUT channel state<br />            Sets the specified digital output channel on a Labjack U3 to the        specified state (0 or 1). Channel must be in the range 4-7. [oma2cam        only]<br />        <br />        DINPUT channel<br />            Sets the specified digital channel on a Labjack U3 for input and        returns the state in command_return_1. Channel must be in the range 4-7.        [oma2cam only]<br />        <br />        DEMOSAIC redX redY [algorithm]<br />            Assume the current image is a raw Bayer intensity profile and        perform demosaicing to produce an RGB image of the same size with three        color channels. redX and redY are the x and y coordinates of the first        red pixel and must be either 0 or 1 (default is 0, 0). The optional        algorithm value specifies what demosaicing algorithm to apply. 0 -&gt;        bilinear (default). 1 -&gt; Malvar.<br />        <br />        DECODEHOBJ<br />            Assume the current image has the proprietary .hobj format (from        Halcon), and has not been decoded. This attempts to decode the image.        See the command HOBJSETTINGS for how this decoding can be done        automatically.<br />        <br />        DSATURATE [displaySaturationValue displayFloorValue]<br />            This affects how the display command behaves when the Scale option        is selected. If a displaySaturationValue is specified, the Color Max        value used will be the dataMax-dataRange*( 1-displaySaturateValue). If a        displayFloorValue is specified, the Color Min value used will be the        dataMinimum + dataRange*displayFloorValue. If no argument is given, the        current values are printed. If displaySaturateValue = 1.0 and no second        argument is given, displayFloorValue is set to 0.0. command_return_1, 2,        3, and 4 are set to displaySaturationValue, displayFloorValue, color        max, and color min.<br />            <br />        DISTORT [k1 subpix x0 y0]<br />            Perform radially symetric image distortion and remapping accorting        to:<br />            x' =  (x-x0)(1+k1*r^2);<br />            y' =  (y-y0)(1+k1*r^2);<br />            x0 and y0 specify the center about which the radius is calculated        and, by default, is at the center of the image. k1 specifies the amount        of image distortion -- negative values correspond to a barrel distortion        and positive values, a pincusion distortion. The default value is k1 =        -0.15. subpix specifies the sub-pixel sampling used in the mapping --        default is 0.1, which would sub-sample each pixel 100 times.<br />        <br />        ERASE [n]<br />            If no argument is given, all image windows currently on the screen        are closed. If a value n is specified, only window n is erased.<br />        <br />        ECHO string<br />            Prints "string" during macro execution. "string" can be replaced        with any of the macro dummy arguments (e.g., ECHO %b).<br />        <br />        ENDIF<br />            Terminates an IF command. This is applicable within Macros only.<br />        <br />        EXECUTE &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Reads OMA commands stored in the specified file into a special        execute buffer and then performs those commands. Unlike macros, these        should not contain dummy numerical arguments (%d).<br />        <br />        EXPOSURE exposureValue<br />            Sets an exposure time to be used in generating HDR images. If no        argument is given, the value of the current exposure is echoed and        command_return_1 returns the value.<br />        <br />        EXTRA [index] [value]<br />            Add extra information to the current image in the form of a floating        point value. Indexing starts at 1. If both arguments are present, the        value is placed at the location specified by the index. If no argument        is given, the command lists extra values in the current image buffer and        puts the first ten extra values into the command_return variables. With        one argument, the extra value at the specified index is put into        command_return_1.<br />         <br />         EXIT<br />            Quit the program.<br />         <br />        FFT mode scale_factor<br />            mode = 0  return the magnitude scaled by scale_factor<br />            mode = 1  return the real part scaled by scale_factor<br />            mode = 2  return the imaginary part scaled by scale_factor<br />            mode = 3  return inverse - input is real part scaled by scale_factor<br />            mode = 4  return inverse - input is imaginary part scaled by        scale_factor<br />            mode = 5  return the log of the magnitude squared scaled by        scale_factor<br />            mode = 6  return the magnitude squared scaled by scale_factor<br />            mode = 7  return the autocorrelation scaled by scale_factor<br />            mode = 8  return inverse - input is a filter scaled by n<br />        <br />        FLOATVARIABLE variable_name<br />            Specifies that variable_name is to be used as a floating point        variable.<br />        <br />        FLOATAUTO &lt;flag&gt;<br />            If flag is nonzero, assignment of a variable to a floating point        value will set its type to FLOAT. If flag is 0, the default INTEGER data        type will be used. With no argument, the current value of the flag is        echoed.<br />        <br />        FOLD fraction new_width<br />            Fold an image in half vertically. It is assumed to be symmetric        about some nearly verticle axis. The center of symmetry is found        separately for each row, except if there are dark regions at the top and        bottom of the image. For the dark regions, the average center of the        middle part of the image is used as the center of symmetry. Dark regions        are rows (at the top and bottom) whose values are all less than        fraction*image_max. x0,y0 and x1,y1 are coordinates of the top and        bottom of the dark region, center is the average center. These are        returned in command_return_1-5.<br />        <br />        FTEMPIMAGE tempImage<br />            Free memory associated with temporary image tempImage. tempImage        must be in the range 0-9, or correspond to a named image. If no argument        is specified, all temporary images are freed.<br />        <br />        FCLOSE<br />            Closes the currently open text file (there can be only one). The use        of FOPEN, FCLOSE, and FECHO allows derived values to be written to a        file from within a macro.<br />        <br />        FECHO string<br />            Writes the string to the file opened with FOPEN. A newLine is added        after the string unless the string ends in ..., in which case no newLine        is added. The use of FOPEN, FCLOSE, and FECHO allows derived values to        be written to a file from within a macro.<br />        <br />        FOPEN &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Open a text file with the name &lt;filename&gt; for I/O. The use of        FOPEN, FCLOSE, and FECHO allows derived values to be written to a file        from within a macro. &lt;filename&gt; should specify the extension        (e.g., .txt or .csv).<br />        <br />        FRAME NewWidth NewHeight [Value] [X0] [Y0]<br />            Put a "frame" around the current image. X0 and Y0 are the        coordinates of the start of the new image in the current image's        coordinate system. X0 and Y0 can be positive (will crop out some of the        current image) or negative (The new image will have a border with the        pixels containing the Value specified). If X0 or Y0 are not integers,        the routine will interpolate pixel values. Default Value is 0. Default        of X0 and Y0 center the old image in the frame.<br />        <br />        FRAMECNTR CenterX HalfWidth [Y0] [Y1] [Value]<br />        Put a "frame" around the current image centered on column CenterX. The        new image width will be 2*HalfWidth+1. Y0 and Y1 specify where the top        and bottom of the new image start. Their default values are 0 and        originalImageHeight-1. If the new image is larger than the original        image, data values are set to Value (default is 0).<br />        <br />        FINDBADPIX Counts [TargetValue] [Passes]<br />            Searches the current image buffer for pixels whose value is more        than "Counts" above that of its nearest eight neighbors. Those pixels        are tagged as hot pixels. This is best applied to a dark image. If the        optional TargetValue is specified, a different algorithm is used that        will get values from 1 to 8 neighboring pixels that are within the        specified number of counts of the target value. A reasonable TargetValue        would be the average A/D offset, e.g., from a dark frame. For the        alternate algorithm, the state of the BAYERFLAG is checked to determine        if the image is color or not. The information is saved in an internal        buffer. See also BAYERFLAG, CLEARBADPIX, WRITEBADPIX, and READBADPIX.<br />        <br />        FWDATMATLAB  &lt;filename&gt; [delimiter]<br />            Writes the data in the current buffer as a text file. If no        delimiter is specified, tab is used and the file will have the Save File        extension. If the delimeter is "," the file gets the .csv extension.        Format is a matrix of values that can be loaded directly into matlab.<br />        <br />        FLIPPID Nx NcLow NcHigh Power Background<br />            Perform an inverse Abel transform using the FLiPPID method. The        current image must satisfy these conditions: (1) it is a right-side-up,        full axisymmetric flame image with an odd number of columns. (2) The        flame must be perfectly centered on the center of the image. Nx should        be slightly larger than the maximum width (in pixels) of the flame.        NcLow and NcHigh relate to a range of radial locations of the maximum;        values of -500 and 2500, respectively seem to work for several flames I        tested. Power is the power used in the fitting function, and could range        from 3 - 7 or more. Higher powers seem to work better for flames with        thin soot regions at the edges. Rows with maximum counts less than        Background will be filled with 0. The image buffer returns the Abel        inverted image. A temporary image named proj is also created -- this is        the projected image created from the fitting function and can be comared        with the original image to assess the quality of the fit. A lookup table        is created based on the values of Nx, NcLow, NcHigh, and Power. The        table is saved to a file in a folder named flippidMatrices in the path        specified by the Save Data Files preference. Before calculating a new        table, the program checks to see if an appropriate table already exists.<br />        <br />        FILTER n<br />            Apply the specified filter matrix to the current image. Filters        (rectangular matrices) are numbered 0 - 9 and are loaded using the        GETFILTER command.<br />        <br />        FILLCIRCLES [extraRadiusAll extraRadiusEdge excludeRadius]<br />         Tries to correct coma. Using the circles found with the CVHOUGHCIRCLES        command, this finds the intensity within each circle and then        redistributes that intesity into a Gaussian distribution centered on the        circle. extraRadiusAll adds a percentage radius to each circle (e.g.,        0.1 makes each circle's radius 10% larger); extraRadiusEdge adds an        increasing percentage radius to circles depending on how far the circle        is from the image center; excludeRadius excludes circles within the        specified radius of the image center. Defaults are 0.0 0.2 0.2 for        extraRadiusAll extraRadiusEdge and excludeRadius, respectively.<br />        <br />        GET &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Loads the data from the specified file into the current image data        buffer. The "Get Data Files" prefix is used. The "Get Data Files" suffix        is used unless the specified filename has a suffix of .jpg, .tiff, .tif,        or .nef; in those cases no suffix is added and the appropriate decoding        routines are called according to the file type.<br />        <br />        GETFILENAMES NameFile<br />            Open NameFile (uses GET DATA FILES prefix and ".txt" as suffix),        which contains the names of files. The NEXTFILE command is used to open        the next file. NameFile is left open until all files have been accessed.        NameFile can be generated with a SHELL command. See also NEXTFILE        command.<br />        <br />        GETFOLDERNAMES FolderFile<br />            Open FolderFile (uses GET DATA FILES prefix and ".txt" as suffix),        which contains the names of folders. The NEXTFOLDER command is used to        read the next folder name. FolderFile is left open until all folders        have been accessed. FolderFile can be generated with a SHELL command.        See also NEXTFOLDER command.<br />         <br />        GETMATCH parameterfile<br />            Load the file matching parameters contained in the text file        "parameterfile".

If no filename is given, OMA        Settings from within the oma application are loaded.<br />        <br />        GETFUNCTION n filename<br />            Read in a tabulated function to be used by the LOOKUP command. n is        the function number to be defined. filename is file containing y=f(x)        data pairs, preceeded by number of table entries.<br />            Assumptions for tabulated functions:<br />            File format:<br />            first number is integer with the number of pairs to follow<br />            pairs are float with x followed by f(x) on the same line<br />            x values are ordered smallest to largest<br />            y = f(x) is single valued<br />        <br />        GETBINARYFILE &lt;filename&gt; rows columns headerBytes        bytesPerDataPoint swapBytesFlag [unsignedFlag]<br />            Read in a binary file with the specified parameters. If        bytesPerDataPoint is -sizeof(float), the binary data are treated as        float. Other reasonable values would be 1, 2, or 4. Specified parameters        do not change those set with the BINARGUMENTS command.<br />        <br />        GETANGLE fraction<br />        For images consisting of tall, symmetric, narrow structures nearly        aligned with the vertical axis (think axisymmetric laminar flames), this        calculates the angle (in degrees) that the current image needs to be        rotated to align the x center of mass with the y axis. This is done        using a linear least squares fit of the vetical coordinate and        horizontal center of mass coordinate. The entire image width is used.        The start of the rectangle considered begins where the maximum along a        horizontal line is greater than "fraction" of the maximum and continues        until the maximum along a horizontal line falls below "fraction" of the        maximum. The required rotation angle and center of mass x location are        returned. After a rotation by the calculated amount, the angle returned        should be small (say &lt; .1 degree) and the location of the center of        mass should correspond to the center of the symmetric image.

If only part of the command is given, a        description of all commands that match the command fragment is printed.        All help information is from the file "OMA HELP." If no argument is        given, all command names are printed with no explanation.<br />        <br />        HDRACADD<br />            Adds the current image data buffer to the HDR accumulator buffer.        Values greater than the cutoff are excluded and values are then        normalized by the exposure time.<br />        <br />        HDRACCUMULATE cutoffMax cutoffMin<br />            Allocates and clears memory for an HDR accumulator that can be used        to generate HDR images from a series of different exposures. The cuttoff        value should be less than the saturation value for the detector. Values        less than cutoffMin are not included; the default for cutoffMin is 0.        The size of the accumulator is determined by the image size parameters        when the accumulate command is first given. Be sure the exposure value        for the image is set (e.g., imported from a raw file or set using the        EXPOSURE command).<br />        <br />        HDRACDELETE<br />            Frees the memory associated with the HDR accumulator.<br />        <br />        HDRACGET<br />            Calculates an HDR image based on the data in the HDR accumulator and        moves that to the current image. The previous contents of the image data        buffer are destroyed.<br />        <br />        HDRNUMGET<br />            Returns an image based on the data in the HDR counter, which has the        number of images that contribute to the HDR image at each pixel. This        "counter" image becomes the current image. The previous contents of the        image data buffer are destroyed.<br />        <br />        HOBJSETTINGS &lt;decodeFlag&gt; &lt;demosaicSetting&gt;        &lt;clearBadPixelsFlag&gt;<br />            With no arguments, this command gives information on how .hobj files        will be read in. If arguments are given, the decodeFlag,        demosaicSetting, and clearBadPixelsFlag are specified. A nonzero        decodeFlag will cause automatic decoding of .hobj files when they are        read in. The demosaicSetting has the following values/meanings: 0 = no        demosaicing done (appropriate for monochrome images); 1 = treat as a        color image and demosaic using DOC2RGB 0 1 1 2; 2 = treat as a color        image and demosaic using the bilinear algorithm with the red pixel at        0,0; 3 = treat as a color image and demosaic using the Malvar algorithm        with the red pixel at 0,0. If the clearBadPixelsFlag is set, bad pixels        previously specified with FINDBAD or READBAD will be set to the average        of their eight nearest neighbors (of the same color -- assumes this is a        raw color image).<br />        <br />         HSV2RGB<br />            Convert the current HSV image to RGB. If the HSV image is in the        range 0-255, the RGB image will also be in the range 0-255. All        calculations are done in floating point.<br />        <br />        IF condition<br />            If condition evaluates to a non-zero value, the commands following        the IF are executed. However, if the condition is zero, the commands        between IF and ENDIF are not executed. The condition can be any        arithmetic statement and can include logical operators &lt; (less than),        &gt; (greater than), others to come....<br />        <br />        IFNOT condition<br />            If condition evaluates to a ZERO value, the commands following the        IF are executed. However, if the condition is nonzero, the commands        between IF and ENDIF are not executed. The condition can be any        arithmetic statement and can include logical operators &lt; (less than),        &gt; (greater than), others to come....<br />        <br />        INVERT<br />            Inverts the image in the current image data buffer, causing the        first data point to become the last data point.<br />        <br />        INTEGRATE direction_flag selection_flag do_average<br />            Sum up the data in the horizontal ( direction_flag=0 ) or vertical        (direction_flag=1)direction. The two-dimensional image becomes a single        line. If selection_flag=1, the subset of the image specified by the        selection rectangle is used. Possible cases are:<br />            direction_flag = 1 The result is an array in x; sum in y direction<br />            direction_flag = 0 The result is an array in y; sum in x direction<br />            selection_box = 1 A selection box specifies what region to sum<br />            selection_box = 0 Sum all channels or tracks <br />            do_average = 1 Average along the integrate direction (divide by box        size in integration direction)<br />            do_average = 0 Just sum, don't average<br />        <br />        INTFILL direction_flag selection_flag do_average<br />            This works like the INTEGRATE command but a two-dimensional image is        formed by duplicating the summed values. If selection_flag=1, the new        image will be the size of the currently defined rectangle.<br />        <br />        INTVARIABLE variable_name<br />            Specifies that variable_name is to be used as an integer variable.<br />        <br />        IM2SEQUENCE filename frames<br />            Save the current image as a sequence of images with the specified        number of frames. This type of data file can be used by the SEQ2HDR        command.<br />        <br />        KILLBOX [value]<br />            Much like FILLBOX, this command works on the region of the image        that has been specified with the RECT command or mouse. The contents of        this region are set to 'value'. Default for 'value' is 0.<br />        <br />        KWABEL n<br />            Uses analytic evaluation of integral required for abel inversion,        which involves a lot of evaluations of ln(x). n is a scale factor for        the image.<br />        <br />        LIST<br />            Lists the current detector parameters and log block.<br />        <br />        LABEL textString [lineNumber]<br />                Display the text_string in the upper left of the current window.        If textString is in quotes, the optional lineNumber (range 0-5)        specifies what line the text appears on.<br />        <br />        LOG [n] [comment]<br />            Adds a comment to the comment buffer at line n. If n is not        specified, the comment is added to the beginning of the comment buffer.        If "comment" is not present, the program prompts for additional comment        lines until a null comment is entered (i.e. &lt;CR&gt; only). If the        optional "comment" is included on the same line, the text of "comment"        replaces any comment already existing at line n and no further comment        lines are solicited.<br />        <br />        LMACRO<br />            Lists the contents in the current macro buffer.<br />        <br />        LOOP variable_name start end [step]<br />            Initializes a loop. The variable_name can be any string of        reasonable length. The variable takes on the initial value specified by        "start" and the commands within the loop are repeated until the variable        is &gt;= "end". ( or &lt;= "end" if step &lt; 0) If step is not        specified, a step of 1 is assumed. The end of the loop is specified by        the LOOPND command. Each LOOP must have a corresponding LOOPND. To        access the value of a loop variable, precede variable_name with "@" For        example:<br />            loop fnum 2 10 2<br />            get data@fnum<br />            disp<br />            loopnd<br />            .<br />            .<br />            Note: To signify the end of a variable name when it is followed by        other characters, use a '\' character. For example:<br />            loop fnum 2 10 2<br />            get data@fnum\_corrected<br />            disp<br />            loopnd<br />        <br />        LOOPBREAK<br />            Break out of current loop.<br />        <br />        LOOPND<br />            Specifies the end of a loop initiated with the LOOP command.<br />        <br />        LOOKUP fn_number <br />            Redefine the current image using the lookup table specified by a        tabulated function.

Mask values are 0 or 1.<br />        <br />        MASK&lt; value<br />            Create a mask based on values in the current image less than the        specified value. Mask values are 0 or 1.<br />        <br />        MATCH image2_data_file<br />            This command is used to create matching image pairs from images        taken with different magnification, displacement, and rotation. The        first image is assumed to be in the current image buffer.        "image2_data_file" specifies the name of a file containing the second        image. The necessary image matching parameters are stored in an ASCII        text file and must be loaded with the GETMATCH command prior to        executing the MATCH command. The command creates two new images and        stores them in files named Match_1 and Match_2. Image 1 should be the        lower resolution of the two.<br />        <br />        MIRROR<br />            Form a left-right mirror image operation on the data in the current        data buffer.<br />        <br />        MULFILE &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Multiplies the contents of the current data buffer by the contents        of the specified file.<br />        <br />        MULTMPIMAGE name<br />            Multiplies the contents of the current data buffer by the contents        of the named temporary image.<br />        <br />        MYSQSERVER server userName password databaseName<br />            Opens a new connection to the named MYSQL database on the specified        server (e.g., cld3.eng.yale.edu) with the userName and password        specified.

The table will contain a numbered imageID and        imageData containing the image displayed in the current data window. In        addition, any variable name beginning with "sql" will be added as a        column to the table (minus the "sql"). [qtoma command]<br />        <br />        NEWWINDOW flag<br />            If flag = 1 (default), a new window will be opened for each        "DISPLAY" command. If flag = 0, the results of "DISPLAY" commands will        be placed in the last-opened window. If no window exists, a new one will        be opened. <br />         <br />        NEXTFILE [prefix] [shortNameLength]<br />          Open the next file specified in the NameFile that was opened with the        GetFileNames command. If a prefix is specified, that is added to the        name before trying to open the file. A leading ; in the filename list        indicates that file should be skipped. The prefix must be specified in        order to set a shortNameLength. command_return_1 is the filename without        any prefix and without the extension (last 4 characters).        command_return_2 is the last shortNameLength characters of the filename        (default is 10).<br />        <br />        <br />        NEXTFOLDER<br />             Read the next entry in the FolderNames file that was opened with        the GETFOLDERNAMES command. command_return_1 has the local folder name.        Typically this would be saved to a variable (e.g., named "folder") for        use in subsequent NEXTFILE commands.<br />        <br />        NOISE average rms [seed]<br />            Creates a noise image with the specified average and rms.

Ordering is HSV rather than RGB. Use the *RGB command to change        various components.<br />        <br />        RMACRO [n m]<br />            Starts executing commands in the macro buffer with %d being replaced        first by value n. Subsequently, n is incremented by the amount specified        in the INCMACRO command (default is 1). If the new numeric value is        equal to m, the macro will be executed again. Menu items can be selected        and the appropriate commands executed during macros. Commands typed        during the execution of a macro will be echoed to the terminal but not        performed. To stop a macro during execution type "cmd ."

"numpix" and "numunits" are both floating point arguments.        An optional string can be included to define the units (e.g., "mm" or        "feet"). If no arguments are given, the current scale factor will be        printed. The scale factor defined with the RULER command is used (1)        when printing lengths using the ruler tool in the status window, (2)        when reporting contour lengths generated by the "Plot Contours" menu        command, and (3) when reporting the x and y "center of mass" using the        calculate rectangle tool in the status window. Scale factor info is        saved with data files and will be reloaded automatically when the files        are retrieved. To "un-define" a ruler, give only one argument.<br />        <br />        REMAP Value1 Value2 [Value3]<br />            With two arguments, every occurence of Value1 in the current image        is replaced with Value2. With three arguments, values in the range from        Value1 to Value2 are set to Value3.<br />        <br />        RAWPARAMS [demosaic subtractBlack applyWhiteBalance applyGamma clearBad]<br />            Controlls whether or not additional processing is done when the        libRaw routines are called to open raw camera data files. If no        parameters are given, the current values of the various flags are        listed. If only the first argument is given, 0 will specify no        additional processing (i.e, raw data is returned); if a single non-zero        argument is given, all corrections will be done. Otherwise, at least        four arguments must be specified and corrections will be done according        to the specified values. subtractBlack = 1 will just subtract the raw        image black value and may have negative values; subtractBlack = 2 will        set the floor to 0. The applyGamma argument is a float, indicating the        gamma correction to be done for all colors. applyGamma=1.0 corresponds        to no nonlinear processing. clearBad is float; 0 means no clearing bad        pixels, 1 means use the existing bad pixels data, any other value is        used as the argument to the FINDBADPIX command.<br />        <br />        SAVEFILE &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Saves the current data buffer to the specified file.<br />        <br />        SAVSETTINGS [filename]<br />            Saves the current settings to the specified file (uses the        appropriate prefix and suffix specified in the preferences).

The 'save' file        prefixes are used. A ".tif" extension is automatically appended to the        filename. To save as a color image, use the COLORFLAG command to set the        flag appropriately.<br />        <br />        SATIFFSCALED min max &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Convert image to 16 bit and save as a TIFF file. Uses the specified        min and max for scaling rather than the min and max of the image in the        buffer. Results will be between 0 - 65535. Depending on min and max, the        image may be clipped or the full 16-bit dynamic range may not be used.        To save as a color image, use the COLORFLAG command to set the flag        appropriately.<br />        <br />        SAVEJPG &lt;filename&gt;<br />            Saves the current image bitmap to a JPG file.

Any text labels        that are displayed on the data window will be part of the pdf. Include        the .pdf extension in the file name.<br />        <br />        SAVEINT &lt;FileName&gt; [typeOfInteger]<br />         Save the data to an oma2 file where the values are converted to        integers. Default is typeOfInteger=16 (unsigned 16-bit integers) Other        options for typeOfInteger are -16 (signed short), 8 (unsigned char), or        -8 (signed char). Out of bounds values for a given type are set to the        type's minimum and maximum -- this modifies the current image as well.        FileName must not contain white-space characters. See also the MAP        command.<br />        <br />        SAVEFITS filename [typeOfData]<br />            Save the current image to a fits format file. Include the .fits        extension in the filename. Valid values for typeOfData are 16 (for        unsigned integers, no underflow/overflow checking is done) and 32 (for        floats). Default is 16.<br />         <br />        SERCLOSE<br />            Closes the serial port opened with the last "SERIAL device_name"        command. This can be used if you need to talk to more than one serial        device -- open device 1, send commands, close the serial port, open        device 2, send commands, and so forth. Available in oma2cam.<br />        <br />        SERIAL device_name (or character_string) [baudRate Timeout]<br />            Provides a simple way of sending text strings to a serial device.        For example, a KeySpan USB to serial converter can be used to control a        variety stepping motor controllers, spectrographs, arduinos etc. The        device name should be something like "/dev/tty.KeySpan1" Note that        upper/lower case matters on these specifications. Look in the "/dev"        directory to find the name of your specific hardware. When opening a        device, the baud rate and timeout value (in thenths of seconds) can be        specified. Defaults are baud = 9600 and timeout = 0. After opening the        device with the first SERIAL command, subsequent SERIAL commands will        send across the specified character_string, followed by a &lt;CR&gt;.        This uses standard POSIX calls.  Available in oma2cam.<br />        <br />        SIZE rows cols <br />            Set the number of rows and columns of the current image and zero the        data.<br />        <br />        SINGRID radius<br />            Draw a grid from the sine function.<br />        <br />        STEMPIMAGE name<br />            Save current image as temporary image with specified name.

The file contains all images and must have information on        exposures stored in the EXTRA data (see the EXTRA command). This type of        file can be created by GigE cameras in oma2cam or can be created using        the CREATEFILE/CONCATENATEFILE/COLSEFILE commands. Note that all        exposure information must be entered in the extra space before        CREATEFILE is used to open the file. Image values larger thatn the        cutoff value will not be included and this should be close to the        detector saturation value.<br />        <br />        SEQ2IMAGE filename<br />            Open all frames of a sequence of images to a single image whose        height is NFRAMES*FRAMEHEIGHT.<br />        <br />        SHOTNOISE seed<br />            Treat the data as counts and add random root N noise to the data.<br />        <br />        SNR gsmoothx gsmoothy aveSize<br />            Calculate the signal/noise ratio of the image by first gaussian        smoothing the image by the specified amount, then dividing the smoothed        image by the original unsmoothed image.

The current image is taken        as a pair of related data sets, with X values on the top half and Y        values on the bottom half. Values 3-6 specify alternate min and max        values for X and Y on the scatter plot. If these arguments are omitted,        the min and max of each half image is used. Default size is 250 by 250        bins in X and Y.<br />        <br />        SETALPHA alphaValue<br />            Sets the alpha channel of the current data window or image window to        alphaValue, where 0 &lt;= alphaValue &lt;=1. For example, an alphaValue        of .25 would result in window transparency of 75%.<br />        <br />         SATURATE factor<br />            Increase the color saturation by the specified factor.<br />        <br />        SQLADD<br />            Adds the current displayed image to the database table previously        opened.

If databaseName.db        already exists, it is deleted and a new database started. The table will        contain a numbered imageID and imageData containing the image displayed        in the current data window. In addition, any variable name beginning        with "sql" will be added as a column to the table (minus the "sql"). See        also MYSQSERVER [qtoma command]<br />        <br />        SQLOPEN databaseName tableName<br />            Opens an existing SQLite database file named databaseName.db and        creates a table named tableName if it doesn't already exist.

[qtoma command]<br />        <br />        STRTIM x0 dy scale_factor<br />            This plots a series of streamlines in a two-component velocity        field. x0 is the starting location of the ray that will be propagated        mainly in the x direction. dy is increment between rays and can be less        than one pixel if a continuous "time elapsed" image is desired. When        more than one elapsed time occurs within a given pixel, the minimum        value is given. The two components of the velocity field are needed. The        y velocity is stored in temporary image 0; the x velocity field is in        the current image buffer. On return, the image is -1 except for the        stream lines. Values along the stream line correspond to elapsed time as        determined by the scale_factor. time = distance/velocity*scale_factor.        Distance is in pixels; velocity as per values in velocity files. A        contour plot will show different residence times.<br />        <br />        TSMOOTH<br />            Smooth radius based on x_dim = Temp[0], y_dim = Temp[1]. This is a        function that enables (Rectangular) smoothing of an image, with variable        filter size. It works basically like SMOOTH 13 13, say, but it takes the        x_dim and y_dim locally based on the values in the  Temporary buffers        T[0] and T[1].
