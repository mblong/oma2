If        the arguments are not given, the &#8220;Auto Scale&#8221; feature is enabled.<br />        <br />        DISPLAY [string] <br />        Opens a window on the Macintosh screen and displays the contents of the        current data buffer. The color palette used can be determined by the        PALETTE command. The color minimum and maximum are specified by the        CMINMX command. There can be up to 9 image windows open at one time.        Windows can be resized, moved around the screen, and closed as in other        Macintosh applications. If the optional string is specified, the window        will be named according to the string.<br />        <br />        DMNMX<br />        Displays the color min and max in the window.<br />        <br />        DRGB [string] <br />        Opens a window and displays the contents of the current image buffer as        an RGB image -- the first third of the image is taken as values for the        red bit plane, the second third of the image represents the green bit        plane, followed by the blue. This is the ordering of data read in from        RAW or JPG images. The CMINMX command and &#8220;+&#8221; and &#8220;-&#8221; buttons in the        status window work as for single-bit-plane images. <br />        <br />        ERASE [n] <br />        If no argument is given, all image windows currently on the screen are        closed. If a value n is specified, only window n is erased.<br />        <br />        NEWWIN flag<br />        If flag = 1 (default), a new window will be opened for each &#8220;DISPLAY&#8221;        command. There can be a maximum of 9 graphics windows open at one time.        If there are already 9 windows open on the screen, subsequent graphics        commands will close the oldest window before opening a new one. If flag        = 0, the results of &#8220;DISPLAY&#8221; commands will be placed in the last-opened        window. If no window exists, a new one will be opened. If the size of        the last-opened window is not appropriate for the current scan        parameters, the last-opened window will be closed and a new window        opened with the correct size.<br />        <br />        PALETTE n<br />        Specifies that the nth predefined color palette should be used. Palette        0 is a color palette; 1 is a gray-scale palette.<br />         <br />         <br />        <br />      </div>      <div class="footer">Brought to you by Developers of OMA<br />          </div>    </div>  </body></html>
