If        the arguments are not given, the &#8220;Auto Scale&#8221; feature is enabled.<br />        <br />        DISPLAY [string] <br />        Opens a window on the Macintosh screen and displays the contents of the        current data buffer. The color palette used can be determined by the        PALETTE command. The color minimum and maximum are specified by the        CMINMX command. There can be up to 10 image windows open at one time.        Windows can be resized, moved around the screen, and closed as in other        Macintosh applications. If the optional string is specified, the window        will be named according to the string.<br />        <br />        DMNMX<br />        Displays the color min and max in the window.<br />        <br />        DRGB [string] <br />        Opens a window and displays the contents of the current image buffer as        an RGB image -- the first third of the image is taken as values for the        red bit plane, the second third of the image represents the green bit        plane, followed by the blue. This is the ordering of data read in from        RAW or JPG images. The CMINMX command and &#8220;+&#8221; and &#8220;-&#8221; buttons in the        status window work as for single-bit-plane images. <br />        <br />        ERASE [n] <br />        If no argument is given, all image windows currently on the screen are        closed. If a value n is specified, only window n is erased.<br />        <br />        LABEL text_string<br />            Display the text_string in the upper left of the current window.<br />        <br />        NEWWIN flag<br />        If flag = 1 (default), a new window will be opened for each &#8220;DISPLAY&#8221;        command. There can be a maximum of 9 graphics windows open at one time.        If there are already 9 windows open on the screen, subsequent graphics        commands will close the oldest window before opening a new one. If flag        = 0, the results of &#8220;DISPLAY&#8221; commands will be placed in the last-opened        window. If no window exists, a new one will be opened. If the size of        the last-opened window is not appropriate for the current scan        parameters, the last-opened window will be closed and a new window        opened with the correct size.<br />        <br />        PALETTE n<br />        Specifies that the nth predefined color palette should be used. Palette        0 is a color palette; 1 is a gray-scale palette.<br />         <br />        PIXSIZE [WindowScaleFactor]<br />            Specifies a scale factor used to determine the size of a window        displayed. PIXSIZE 1 associates one screen point with one data point. If        WindowScaleFactor is negative, a scale factor of -1/WindowScaleFactor is        used. If no argument is given, the current WindowScaleFactor is printed.<br />        <br />        <span style="font-weight: bold;">** Information Display Commands**</span><br />        <br />        CALCULATE<br />            Print calculations on the rectangle specified with the RECTANGLE        command or with the rectangle tools. The average, rms, # of points, and        the x and y "center of mass" are printed. The mean, rms, centroid_X and        centroid_Y are passed to the command_return_variables.<br />        <br />        CALCALL<br />            Print calculations on the entire image. The average, rms, # of        points, and the x and y "center of mass" are printed. The mean, rms,        centroid_X and centroid_Y are passed to the command_return_variables.<br />        <br />        HELP [command name or fragment]<br />            If a command name is given, a brief explanation of the command is        printed in the command window. If only part of the command is given, a        description of all commands that match the command fragment is printed.        All help information is from the file "OMA HELP." If no argument is        given, all command names are printed with no explanation.<br />        <br />        LIST<br />            Lists the current detector parameters and log block.<br />        <br />        LOG [n] [comment]<br />            Adds a comment to the comment buffer at line n. If n is not        specified, the comment is added to the beginning of the comment buffer.        If "comment" is not present, the program prompts for additional comment        lines until a null comment is entered (i.e. &lt;CR&gt; only). If the        optional "comment" is included on the same line, the text of "comment"        replaces any comment already existing at line n and no further comment        lines are solicited.<br />        <br />        RULER [numpix] [numunits] [unit name] <br />            Can be used to specify the number of pixels that correspond to a        length unit. "numpix" and "numunits" are both floating point arguments.        An optional string can be included to define the units (e.g., "mm" or        "feet"). If no arguments are given, the current scale factor will be        printed. The scale factor defined with the RULER command is used (1)        when printing lengths using the ruler tool in the status window, (2)        when reporting contour lengths generated by the "Plot Contours" menu        command, and (3) when reporting the x and y "center of mass" using the        calculate rectangle tool in the status window. Scale factor info is        saved with data files and will be reloaded automatically when the files        are retrieved. To "un-define" a ruler, give only one argument.<br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />      </div>      <div class="footer">Brought to you by Developers of OMA<br />          </div>    </div>  </body></html>
