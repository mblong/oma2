√load and save prefs -- do on start and quit

√macros enabled and define macros
    √define macro starting at line number doesn't work right
     
initializations:
    √palettes
    √prefs

√drag and drop -- shouldn't use fullname

√when displaying in a macro, window should draw contents before the end of the macro
      this also causes a malloc error in drawRect when guard malloc is enabled
      
√crop of color image has bad access if rectangle goes all the way to the bottom of the image
    √also trouble with monochrome crop -- problem is with vertical part of rectangle coorinates returned by the UI
    I'm using a defined constant for the TITLEBAR_HEIGHT -- that probably isn't right

√rework min/max

Status Window:
    √ show color bar

√ help file

√printf

√GET anImage.nef and anImage.jpg    -- implemented; needs verification
√SAVE command -- added
√LIST command
√NEWWINDOW command
√ GETFILENAMES
√ NEXTFILE
√ STRMACRO
√ GMACRO
√ GETFILENAMES
√ NEXT
√ RMACRO added
√ POWER added
√ ^ added as alias of POWER
√ added MAKNEW to resize image
√ added SINGRID command
√ added FFT command
√ added FILLBOX command
√ added POSITIVE command

Addressed Existing Command Issues:
    √ CROP has bugs when image is big
    √ ERASE [n] to just erase nth window
    √ CALC -- doesn't fill in command return values; doesn't use the right rectangle?
    √ redefined the way SIZE works; now SIZE rows columns

Addressed UI Issues:
  √ Big image issues:
        Image scaling is wrong when image is big -- scales vertically but not horizontally
        X Y coordinates (and Z values) are wrong
        Presumably this is the source of the trouble with the CROP command
  √ copy from an image window
  √ release window when click on close
  √ Need to implement command history and up arrow
  
  √ Strange behavior on running oma2 from guilford -- fullname crashes when the suffix is present: re established oma2Command array in CommandView

  

  
  Row/Column Plots:
            √Crashes on print or resize of drawing window (fixed)
            √Can't copy (but can print) (fixed)

  
  √ When not started from Xcode, oma2 can't read resource files, which causes trouble with settings, help, and non-computed palettes

  √ when the status window is selected, typing a space isn't sent to the command window -- sometimes?
  
  √ Plot Rows and Cols -- scaling of plots needs attention -- y scale is wrong?
  
  √ on typing, always move cursor to end of command buffer
  
  √ Need to be able to stop macros -- seems OK now, but still potetial problems
        using GCD seems OK for now

  √ Echo in macros still has challenges. If a macro is started when the command window does not have focus, nothing is echoed until the macro finishes

  √ on typing, always move cursor to end of command buffer

Needed Commands
 LOG command
 GET command --  ".tif" still needed.

UI Issues:

    
    Crash on resizing data window that isn't the current one when size is smaller than original. in DataView.mm drawRect
        
    Crash on copy data window that isn't the current one 

    
UI Needs


    -> open a lineplot window and plot graphics
        get the bitmap data from a window for line plots
        Still issues here:
            Bitmap returned is different than the one set due to display profile mapping


    Prefs:
        -> select color bar
        -> Improve prefix/suffix setting

    Status:
        -> Display macro number
        
    Menu:
        -> Open, Save, Save Settings
        
    Double Click: 
    
    File Typing

Implementation Notes

Display a data window
in comdec.mm:
display_data (alias to #define display_data [appController showDataWindow:(char*) args]; in UI.h)

  appController showDataWindow:windowname (invoked from from display as above)
    // figure out where to place image
    screen size is:
        screenRect.size.width
        screenRect.size.height

To find which window is active:
    [NSApp keyWindow]       -- NSApp is a global defined in Cocoa
